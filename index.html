            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I'm a 21 year old full time student at NTNU in Gj√∏vik. I study Web Development, and will graduate with a
                Bachelor's degree in 2023 (that's the plan at least ;))</p>
            <p>My hobbies include coding, music, hiking, and technology in general. At the time writing this, I know
                HTML5 and CSS, but I'm also learning SASS and JavaScript. I'm looking forward to work both with front
                and back-end tehnologies in the future.</p>
